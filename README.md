## Introduction:
This is a simple minecraft bukkit plugin that lets players puke once they leave a minecart. There are a few things that you can configure (see config file). If you discover any bugs, errors or if you want a function to be added, please let me know.

## Commands:

```
/vomit
Description: Reloads the config file
Permissions: vomit.reload
```

## Permissions:

```
vomit.allow -> Checks if player is allowed to vomit
vomit.reload -> permission to use the /vomit command
```

## Config file:

```
Chance to puke (%): The change needs to be a number between 0 and 100
Time (seconds): How long players will puke
Message:
  Enable: true (set to false if you don't want a player to receive a message)
  Start vomit: The message players receive when they start vomitting
  Stop vomit: The message players receive when they stop vomitting
  ```
